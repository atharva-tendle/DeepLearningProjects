# DeepLearningProjects
Series of projects implementing deep learning algorithms.
These projects were created as a part of my Deep Learning Nanodegree.
All of these projects were graded and were required for my certification.

## bike-sharing-nn
* Implements a Deep Neural Network for classifying Bike Sharing Patterns

## dog-classifier
* Various implementations of Convolutional Neural Networks which classify dogs.
* Two main models:
    - Custom CNN
    - Resnet Transfer Learning

## tv-script-gen
* Implements a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) used to generate TV scripts

## face-gen
* Implements of a Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial Network (DCGAN) which can generate celebrity faces.

## sagemaker-sentiment
* Implements a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) for Sentiment Analysis.
* Trained using AWS Sagemaker.
* Deployed using AWS Lambda and API-Gateway.
